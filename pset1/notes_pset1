Data Types and Variables

Five Primary types of data you'll encounter in C (+2 from CS50)

1. int - 4 bytes of memory (32 bits)
    unsigned int - double positive range at the expense of negative values
    short, long, const (other qualifiers)

2. char - store single character, 1 byte, 8 bits
    A maps to 65 per ASCII, a to 95, 0 to 48

3. float - "real numbers", 4 bytes of memory (32 bits)
    only can be so precise, float imprecision

4. double - store "real numbers", but double precision, 8 bytes of memory
    64 bits

5. void - is a type, but not a data  type, if fn doesn't return a value it
    returns void. void is a placeholder, no paramaters, no return value

CS50 Created:

1. bool (CS50 created - two distinct values, T or F)
2. string (CS50 created - collection of words, series of characters)

Later:

structs, typedefs...

Creating Variables - define type & name it

int number; // declaration
number = 17 // assignment

int number = 17; // initialization
char letter = "M" // initialization

Operators

+, -, *, /, =, % (get the remainder)

***loops
3 kinds

while (do while an expression is true)
do...while (run code at least once, common to use for user input)
for (repeat discrete # of times)
